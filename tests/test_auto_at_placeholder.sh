# Feature test: when the coverage binary is built from the cov-analysis driver
# (it reads inputs from file arguments, not stdin) and the user forgot the @@
# placeholder, cov-analysis must behave as if "<cmd> @@" had been given.
#
# Without the auto-@@ behaviour a driver binary invoked without @@ falls into
# stdin-feeding mode, the driver receives no file arguments, and no corpus input
# is ever replayed — so coverage is empty. The fix appends @@ automatically.
